    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our Terms of Service. These Terms govern your use of the PGRP Bot, a custom-developed Discord application designed for community management, roleplay enhancements, and support functionalities within the Pigeon's Greenville Roleplay (PGRP) server. By accessing or interacting with the Bot in any form, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully. If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not use the Bot or any related services.</p>

<section>
  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By utilizing the PGRP Bot, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to comply with these Terms of Service. These Terms may be revised periodically without prior notice. Continued use of the Bot following any changes constitutes your acceptance of those updates. It is your responsibility to review the Terms regularly to remain informed about any modifications.</p>
  <p>Users who violate these Terms may be subject to warnings, restrictions, or a complete revocation of access to the Bot, depending on the severity of the infraction. Ignorance of the Terms is not a valid defense against enforcement actions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Use of the Bot</h2>
  <p>The Bot is intended exclusively for use within the PGRP community and its associated systems. It provides automation for sessions, vehicle registration, LEO ticketing, and data lookups. You may use the Bot for its intended purposes only and must refrain from abusing, exploiting, or attempting to reverse engineer its functionalities.</p>
  <p>Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Triggering excessive or spammy commands</li>
    <li>Attempting to bypass permissions, cooldowns, or role requirements</li>
    <li>Using macros, bots, or automation to interact with the Bot outside of its intended use</li>
    <li>Providing false, misleading, or unauthorized information during interactions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Users found engaging in prohibited behavior may be subject to disciplinary action by the PGRP Staff Team and have their Bot access removed indefinitely.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for your actions when using the Bot, including all data you submit, such as vehicle information, LEO ticket content, and any other inputs. You agree not to use the Bot in any way that is unlawful, harmful, or violates Discord’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service.</p>
  <p>When registering vehicles or making an LEO ticket, you must ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of the content. Submitting false information, impersonating others, or misusing the system may result in temporary or permanent removal from the Bot’s services.</p>
  <p>The Bot logs certain data for the purpose of improving service quality, supporting user needs, and tracking violations. These logs may include command interactions, message content within tickets, timestamps, and user identifiers. Refer to the Privacy Policy for details regarding data collection and storage.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The Bot's source code, visual assets, design, and functionality are the exclusive intellectual property of the PGRP development team or its authorized developers. Unauthorized use, duplication, or distribution of any aspect of the Bot—including its command structure, embeds, style, or interactive systems—is strictly prohibited.</p>
  <p>You may not reproduce, reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works based on the Bot or any part of its codebase or structure without explicit written permission. Violations of intellectual property rights may result in legal action or Discord platform enforcement.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Limitations and Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The Bot is provided “as is” without warranty or guarantee of uptime, feature availability, or performance. While we strive for accuracy and reliability, the Bot may experience occasional downtime, bugs, or unintentional behavior.</p>
  <p>By using the Bot, you acknowledge that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There may be unintentional errors in output or command results</li>
    <li>The Bot may be temporarily or permanently discontinued at any time</li>
    <li>We are not liable for any damages resulting from incorrect output, system crashes, or misuse</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Bot is not a substitute for server moderation or judgment. Staff discretion and server rules supersede Bot behavior at all times.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Modifications to Terms</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to update, modify, or amend these Terms of Service at any time without direct notification. It is your responsibility to remain informed of the latest version by reviewing the Terms periodically. Material changes may be communicated via server announcements, but continued usage implies your acceptance regardless of notice.</p>
  <p>In the event of a conflict between a previous and updated version of these Terms, the most recent version will prevail.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>Your access to the Bot may be terminated or suspended at any time for any reason, including violation of these Terms, server misconduct, or technical abuse. Termination may be temporary or permanent depending on the circumstances, and PGRP staff reserve the right to escalate actions based on server policy.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the Bot developer may remove access to the Bot globally for maintenance, discontinuation, or re-development. No guarantee is made regarding data retention or future availability.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, clarification, or disputes related to these Terms of Service, please contact the PGRP Bot developer directly through Discord, or reach out via official PGRP communication channels such as support tickets or staff messages.</p>
  <p>All requests related to legal matters, account access, or serious violations will be handled in accordance with server procedures and at the discretion of the PGRP leadership team.</p>
