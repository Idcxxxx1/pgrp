   <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy outlines how the PGRP Discord Bot (“the Bot”) collects, uses, stores, and discloses your data when you interact with its features. By using the Bot, you acknowledge and consent to the practices described below. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, you should refrain from using the Bot or its associated services.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      When you use the PGRP Bot, we collect certain information directly through Discord's platform and indirectly through your interactions. This includes, but is not limited to, your Discord user ID, username, discriminator, avatar URL, roles, server ID, message content (in limited, non-personal use cases such as tickets), timestamps, and any command arguments or form data you submit voluntarily (e.g., vehicle registration details, reports, appeals, and session logs).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we may collect metadata from your interactions such as channel IDs, message IDs, server activity logs, and ticket statuses. All of this is collected solely for the purpose of operating the Bot effectively and serving community needs within PGRP.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      The data collected is used to power key features of the Bot, such as the ability to register vehicles, manage in-character tickets, track license statuses, display user profiles, generate transcripts, handle staff assistance, and improve community management. Your information allows us to provide personalized features tied to your user ID, automate processes, and ensure accountability across server operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, certain information may be used to enforce community rules, prevent abuse, and ensure fair roleplay practices within the PGRP environment. In rare cases, your data may be accessed for moderation or disciplinary purposes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Sharing of Data with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      Your data may be shared with trusted third-party services essential to the operation of the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, external MySQL database providers used for storing structured data, hosting services that operate the Bot's runtime, and analytics tools used for uptime monitoring or performance improvements. All third parties used are selected for their reliability and security standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      These services do not access your data for advertising or external marketing purposes, and we do not sell or rent your data to anyone. However, by using the Bot, you understand that some data — especially operational and technical — may transit or reside within third-party infrastructure which is governed by its own security and privacy practices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Your data is securely stored in managed databases hosted by third-party providers with strict access controls. We apply reasonable technical measures, including encryption in transit, access authentication, and routine security checks to minimize risks of unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. Only authorized developers or staff personnel can access the stored data, and only when necessary for support, moderation, or technical purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we take data security seriously, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure. By using the Bot, you acknowledge that there is always a risk inherent in transmitting data online and agree to use the Bot at your own discretion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Data submitted through the Bot, such as vehicle registrations, user profiles, ticket histories, transcripts, and arrest records, is retained for as long as it is needed to support operational and historical purposes within the community. We do not automatically delete data unless explicitly requested or unless required to do so by moderation action, rule enforcement, or regular cleanup procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some logs and actions, such as ticket closings or staff interactions, may be retained indefinitely for audit purposes. Users should assume that any command or action they perform through the Bot is logged and stored securely, even if the visible message is deleted.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. User Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>
      Users have the right to request access to the information stored about them by the Bot, including vehicle records, ticket history, or arrest logs. Requests should be submitted through proper channels, such as a support ticket or contact with an admin. In most cases, users can also request corrections or removal of specific information, provided it does not conflict with staff decisions or community guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full removal of a user’s data may not be feasible in cases where it is tied to server enforcement records, legal actions, or public logs. We will always assess each request on a case-by-case basis and respond in a timely manner.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot and its services are intended for users aged 13 and above, in compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service. We do not knowingly collect information from individuals under the age of 13. If it is discovered that such data has been collected inadvertently, it will be deleted immediately upon verification.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time to reflect changes in how the Bot operates, how data is handled, or to comply with evolving laws and platform requirements. When material changes occur, we will notify users via an update in the server or through the Bot’s update logs. Continued use of the Bot after such changes implies acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please contact the developer directly via Discord or through the appropriate PGRP support channels. We are committed to maintaining transparency and protecting your privacy to the best of our ability.
