    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy outlines how the PGRP Bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, stores, and discloses data from users interacting with the Bot within the Pigeon's Greenville Roleplay (PGRP) Discord server. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree, you should refrain from using the Bot or interacting with its features.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      When you interact with the Bot, we collect limited personal information necessary to deliver the intended features. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Discord user ID, username, and avatar (for identification and ticket linking)</li>
      <li>Command usage logs, including timestamps and command content</li>
      <li>Vehicle registration data (e.g. license plate, make, model, year, color)</li>
      <li>Ticket details such as reason, assigned staff, and messages exchanged in Bot-managed channels</li>
      <li>Session logs for administrative events like hosting, co-hosting, or ending sessions</li>
      <li>License status, warrant status, and other in-server record data related to roleplay systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect or store sensitive personal information such as real names, email addresses, passwords, or location data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      The information collected is used solely for the purpose of operating, improving, and managing the Bot's features within the PGRP Discord server. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Displaying information in embeds and dashboards (e.g., /profile)</li>
      <li>Managing and verifying user-submitted roleplay data (e.g., vehicle registration, ticket handling)</li>
      <li>Tracking user activity related to moderation or administrative functions (e.g., sessions, reports)</li>
      <li>Sending transcripts of closed tickets to appropriate staff channels for transparency</li>
      <li>Preventing abuse or exploitation of the Bot by logging improper command usage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your data is never used for advertising, tracking outside Discord, or shared with third parties without valid reason and approval.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Your data may be shared internally within the PGRP staff team for operational, moderation, and administrative purposes. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Staff reviewing session data or ticket logs</li>
      <li>Moderators accessing warrant/license/arrest records as part of in-role enforcement</li>
      <li>Transcripts or logs being archived for internal reports or audits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Data is not sold, rented, or transferred to external services, advertisers, or unrelated parties. Access to data is restricted to trusted personnel and used only as needed for server operations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot retains certain user data (such as vehicle registrations, tickets, and arrest records) until explicitly deleted or until a cleanup/reset is performed as part of bot maintenance. Session data and transcripts may be archived indefinitely for internal use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users may request deletion of specific data they have submitted (e.g., removing a registered vehicle), but complete data removal (e.g., full user profile deletion) is subject to staff approval and limited to reasonable cases. For privacy-related deletion requests, open a support ticket in the server.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      The Bot uses secure storage practices, including MySQL databases with controlled access. Access to user data is limited to the developer and trusted server administrators. The Bot does not expose user data publicly and uses permissions to restrict who can view or edit sensitive information within Discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we take reasonable precautions to protect data, no system is entirely immune to breaches. In the event of a data issue, affected users will be notified if applicable, and appropriate action will be taken to resolve the issue.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Children’s Data</h2>
    <p>
      The PGRP Discord server and the Bot are not directed toward users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under this age in accordance with Discord’s Terms of Service. If it is discovered that a user under 13 is interacting with the Bot, their data may be deleted and access restricted.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page with the revised effective date. Continued use of the Bot after changes are made implies acceptance of the new policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions, concerns, or requests related to your data, please contact the PGRP Bot developer via Discord or submit a support ticket in the official server. We are committed to maintaining your privacy and will respond to inquiries in a timely and respectful manner.
