    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 14, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
    This Privacy Policy explains how PGRP Bot ("we", "our", or "the bot") collects, uses, stores, and protects information from users on Discord servers where the bot is invited and used.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Discord User Data:</strong> User IDs, usernames, and interaction logs for command usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Vehicle Registration Data:</strong> Custom user-submitted vehicle information including license plates, make, model, year, and color.</li>
      <li><strong>Tickets & Support Logs:</strong> User-created tickets with message transcripts, claimed by information, and session logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Command Logs:</strong> Usage records for internal diagnostics (e.g., session starts, co-hosts, reinvites).</li>
      <li><strong>MySQL Data:</strong> All aforementioned data is stored securely in a MySQL database.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2. How We Use This Data</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide bot functionalities (commands, automations, ticket systems).</li>
      <li>To generate session logs and vehicle/ticket profiles.</li>
      <li>To maintain security and moderation logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Data Storage & Security</strong><br>
    All data is stored securely in a private MySQL database, protected by authentication and access restrictions. The bot is hosted on Cybrancee, which provides server-side security controls.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Data Sharing</strong><br>
    We do not share user data with any third parties. All information is used solely for internal bot operations within the PGRP server.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Data Retention</strong><br>
    Data such as vehicle registrations and ticket logs are retained until explicitly deleted by a moderator or command (e.g., `/unregister`, `/ticketremove`).</p>

    <p><strong>6. User Rights</strong><br>
    Users can request deletion of their data by contacting the PGRP server moderators or submitting a ticket in the appropriate channel.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Changes to This Policy</strong><br>
    We may update this Privacy Policy as the bot grows. Users will be notified of significant changes via Discord announcements.</p>

    <p><strong>Contact</strong><br>
    For privacy concerns or questions, open a support ticket or contact <code>@idcxxxx1</code> directly in the PGRP Discord server.</p>
